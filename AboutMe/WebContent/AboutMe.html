		<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>My name is Daniel Svirida. I am a running start <tt>student</tt> at Green River doing my last quarter of my AA degree. 
			After my AA degree I am planning on pursuing the Bachelors of Applied Science in Software Development starting winter quarter.
			<p>I really love learning and constantly am learning something new aside from <tt>school</tt> which has really helped me figure out what
			I want to do in life, even though I'm still heading towards the same direction I wanted to be when I was in 2nd grade. Well, Obviously
			the exact area of work changed. It got more specific. But overall, it's still in the same direction and in the same field pretty much.
			In 2nd grade I wanted to be an <font size=5>Inventor</font>, I had a great passion for <u>creating</u> things. And by now, going in to Software Development, you
			could still say I'm creating things. I've built <font color=#FF0000>racing drones</font>, work on cars, built programs and computers, and so on. I think the fact
			that I know which path I want to take is my <strong>advantage</strong> over other people.
