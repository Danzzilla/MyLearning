# Critters
The program creates a little simulation where different critters battle each other out, 
starting at set numbers in each critter group. Each of the critter files has the actions of each critter written in
and the main file initiates the critter to act when it is its turn. The critter performs different actions depending
on its situation. This program was assigned in a class I was taking.
The files that I made were
* Bear.java
* Eagle.java
* Gator.java
* Giant.java
* Lion.java

### (JAVA FILES IN SRC)
