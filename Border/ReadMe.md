### (JAVA FILES IN SRC)

## Things I've learned
* When printing, typing "\\" prints out "\"
* On the side ive learned more about the difference of gradle projects and regular java projects
* I also have learned on the side what exactly CircleCi is for (after already implementing it into the project though). Ive implemented it automatically before because of the 
caesar-sipher program and on the steps ive followed along through the video when I was doing it. Now it will be implemented in projects that will have tests included in them. 
* Learned that CircleCi is compatible with gradle and maven projects for java
* learned to take this project off of CircleCi
* And more knowledge built on top of what i already know
