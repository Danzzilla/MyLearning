# QuestionGame
This was an assignment in a Java class I took. In the game, you think of an object, and the game tries to guess it.
If the game didn't guess it, you write in a question to distinguish it from a previous item the game guessed and it stores the new object in its memory.
The game asks you which file you want to load, you can choose "question1.txt", "question2.txt", "animals.txt", or "memory.txt" 
which is the file that stores the new items you added into the game.
My job was to make the user interface use a Tree Node for storing and using the questions and answers.

The files I made were QuestionTree.java and QuestionNode.java

### (JAVA FILES IN SRC)
## What I've Learned
* Using Nodes as a data structure
* Storing that data in a text file
* Reading data from a text file
