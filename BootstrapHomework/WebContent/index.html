				<p>So I've bought a pretty rare BMW about a year ago. The reason why the car is rare is because of its manual transmission. Only 1300 e39 tourings were fitted with a manual transmission. 
				I originally bought the car with intentions of making it into an m5 (no m5 tourings were made). Now though, I've decided to keep it as it is since it is quite rare already. My plans for now are
				to make it look nice with m sport exterior and interior details. First off though I decided to swap out the ugly tan interior to a black interior with the m sport black headliner option. M sport
				bumpers will be going on next, after that I'll get it nicer wheels, upgrade the suspension, and more. After I feel like the car doesn't look bad anymore, I'll move towards the engine and start
				getting more power out of that. </p>

				<p>I havent touched the car in a while though because of school. It has been sitting in the garage on jack stands for a while. I've just been getting to it whenever I can. Currently it has
				the transmission removed, recieving a clutch change. I havent touched the car in months because of my life taking so many unexpected turns. The clutch change still hasnt been finished because I
				have found some problems with the transmission internals so I'm doing that while the transmission is out anyways. I don't know when it's going to be back on the road again though because with
				school and everything it's tricky finding time for the car.</p>
